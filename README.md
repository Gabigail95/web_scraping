# web_scraping
For this challenge, the focus will be on web-scraping Mars data.

# This challenge will consist of two parts:
1.	Scraping of titles and preview of text from Mars news articles. Please see Jupyter Notebook: part_1_mars_news.ipynb
2.	Scraping and analysis of Mars weather data. Please see Jupyter Notebook: part_2_mars_weather.ipynb

# Data analysis from above web-scraping: 
1.	How many months exist on Mars?
There are a total of 12 months on Mars 
2.	How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
The number of Martian days worth of data totals to 1867
3.	What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? 
-	The coldest month on Mars: 3rd 
-	The warmest month on Mars: 8th
-	The average low temps. By month:
o	1    -77.160920
o	2    -79.932584
o	3    -83.307292
o	4    -82.747423
